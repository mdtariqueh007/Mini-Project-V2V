# Mini-Project-V2V
Project Topic: Analyse real-world traffic data to understand, model, and predict human driving trajectories

Project Description:

The project addresses the pressing issue of traffic congestion, which poses significant challenges in many cities, leading to wasted time, increased fuel consumption, and heightened greenhouse gas emissions. To tackle this problem, our project focuses on analyzing real-world traffic data to gain a comprehensive understanding of human driving behavior and develop accurate trajectory models.

The outcomes of this project are expected to make significant contributions to the growing field of traffic analysis and trajectory modeling. By developing more accurate and efficient models, we can inform the design of transportation systems and policies that prioritize safety, sustainability, and efficiency. Furthermore, the insights gained from this research have the potential to shape the development of intelligent transportation systems, paving the way for enhanced traffic flow, reduced congestion and accidents, and ultimately, more reliable and environmentally-friendly transportation networks.

The project integrates network simulators, such as SUMO and VEINS, with OpenStreetMap maps to create realistic vehicular simulations. By modeling geographic locations and simulating the behavior of vehicles, we can analyze the impact of various factors on traffic flow and optimize the design of transportation systems in specific areas.

In conclusion, our project aims to address the challenges posed by traffic congestion by analyzing real-world traffic data, developing accurate trajectory models, and leveraging advanced communication technologies. By gaining a deep understanding of human driving behavior and optimizing traffic flow, we aspire to contribute to the creation of safe, sustainable, and efficient transportation systems that benefit individuals, communities, and the environment.
